# False Positive/Negative Feedback Loop

## Bot Feedback Loop

The Bots Feedback Loop is an easy way for customers to send Cloudflare direct feedback in the case of Bot Management potentially scoring a request incorrectly. Before, customers could only report issues with bot scores via a support ticket or directly to their account team. 

Now, the Bots Feedback Loop allows users to submit feedback via the API. When a customer submits a False Negative or a False Positive report, Cloudflare manually analyzes this data and use it as a training dataset for our next Machine Learning model.

## Availability

Anyone who has access to Bot Analytics is able to submit feedback. Business and Enterprise customers who have Super Bot Fight Mode enabled will also be able to submit feedback.
